Existing K3S deployment.

Goal: Redeploy from development to production env. 
Refactor full cluster to be quickly deployable and scaleable
Charts should be available here and updated here.

Easier faster.


Action Plan:
Note down Helm charts used in current deployment
-> Note any amendedments made to the Charts AFTER deployment of HELM chart.
-> Create own HELM chart to support stable operation
-> Create a straight forward deployment steps that are easy to follow and repeatable.
